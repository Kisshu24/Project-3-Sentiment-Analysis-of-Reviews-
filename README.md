# Project-3-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Reviews-
## This is a project to perform sentiment analysis on reviews using an API such as Yelp Fusion

## My Analysis include the following in the file Project-3:

### Introduction
- Use the API to search for at least 60 reviews about your topic. (Note Yelp Fusion only delivers 3 reviews per business.)
- Clean your reviews as needed.
- Perform sentiment analysis on these reviews, displaying a donut chart of the positive, negative, and neutral percentages. Use the default Textblob analyzer and then compare it with the results of the NaiveBayesAnalyzer.
- Delete the stop words from the reviews using the NLTK library stop-words lists.
- Display a WordCloud of the top 20 words used in the reviews you cleaned.
- Conclusion (in Markdown): include insights that you learned from this analysis.
